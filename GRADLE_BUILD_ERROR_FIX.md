# Gradle Build Error Fix Guide

## 🐛 **Error Analysis**

**Error Type**: Gradle task `stripDebugDebugSymbols` failure
**Root Cause**: Build cache corruption and missing native library files
**Impact**: Prevents app from building and running

## 🔧 **Solution Steps (Try in Order)**

### **Step 1: Clean Flutter Build Cache**
```bash
flutter clean
```

### **Step 2: Clean Gradle Cache**
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
```

### **Step 3: Get Dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### **Step 4: Try Building Again**
```bash
flutter run
```

## 🚀 **If Step 1-4 Don't Work, Try Advanced Fixes**

### **Step 5: Clear All Gradle Caches**
```bash
# Navigate to android directory
cd android

# Clean with more options
./gradlew clean --no-daemon

# Go back to project root
cd ..
```

### **Step 6: Delete Build Directories**
Delete these folders manually:
- `build/` (in project root)
- `android/build/` 
- `android/app/build/`

### **Step 7: Clear Gradle User Cache**
```bash
# Windows
rmdir /s "%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\caches"

# Or manually delete:
# C:\Users\[YourUsername]\.gradle\caches
```

### **Step 8: Rebuild Everything**
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## 💻 **Windows-Specific Commands**

Since you're on Windows, use these commands:

```cmd
# Clean Flutter
flutter clean

# Clean Gradle (in project directory)
cd android
gradlew.bat clean
cd ..

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Try running
flutter run
```

## 🔍 **Alternative Solutions**

### **Option A: Use Different Build Mode**
```bash
# Try release mode instead of debug
flutter run --release
```

### **Option B: Specify Target Platform**
```bash
# Build for specific architecture
flutter run --target-platform android-arm64
```

### **Option C: Disable Gradle Daemon**
```bash
# Run with disabled daemon
flutter run --no-gradle-daemon
```

## 🛠️ **Manual Cache Cleanup**

If commands don't work, manually delete these folders:

### **Project Level**
- `H:\FINAL PROJECT PLP\haki_yangu\build\`
- `H:\FINAL PROJECT PLP\haki_yangu\android\build\`
- `H:\FINAL PROJECT PLP\haki_yangu\android\app\build\`

### **System Level (Windows)**
- `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\.gradle\caches\`
- `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\.android\build-cache\`

## ⚡ **Quick Fix Script**

Create a batch file with these commands:

```batch
@echo off
echo Cleaning Flutter project...
flutter clean

echo Cleaning Gradle...
cd android
gradlew.bat clean
cd ..

echo Getting dependencies...
flutter pub get

echo Attempting to run...
flutter run

pause
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After following these steps:
- ✅ Build cache cleared
- ✅ Gradle cache cleaned
- ✅ Dependencies refreshed
- ✅ App should build successfully
- ✅ Your text changes should be visible

## 🚨 **If Error Persists**

### **Check These Issues**
1. **Disk Space**: Ensure you have enough free space
2. **Antivirus**: Temporarily disable antivirus during build
3. **Path Length**: Windows path length limitations
4. **Permissions**: Run terminal as administrator

### **Nuclear Option: Fresh Clone**
If nothing works:
1. Backup your changes
2. Clone the project fresh
3. Apply your changes again
4. This ensures clean build environment

## 📝 **Prevention Tips**

1. **Regular Cleaning**: Run `flutter clean` periodically
2. **Avoid Interrupting Builds**: Let builds complete fully
3. **Stable Internet**: Ensure stable connection during builds
4. **Updated Tools**: Keep Flutter and Android SDK updated

## ✅ **Success Indicators**

You'll know it's fixed when:
- Build completes without errors
- App launches successfully
- Your text changes are visible:
  - "Modules Done" instead of "Modules"
  - "Test Your Knowledge" instead of "Know Your Rights"
  - "Learn rights in a simplified way"
  - "Take a Civic quiz"

Try the steps in order, and your app should build successfully! 🚀
