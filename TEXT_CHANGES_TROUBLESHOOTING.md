## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting Steps**

### **Step 1: Hot Restart (Recommended)**
If you're running the app in debug mode:
1. **Press `R` in the terminal** where `flutter run` is running
2. Or **press the hot restart button** in your IDE
3. This will restart the app and load your changes

### **Step 2: Stop and Restart App**
If hot restart doesn't work:
1. **Stop the app** (Ctrl+C in terminal or stop button in IDE)
2. **Run the app again** with `flutter run`
3. Your changes should now be visible

### **Step 3: Clean Build (If needed)**
If changes still don't appear:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### **Step 4: Check Device/Emulator**
- Make sure you're looking at the **correct screen**
- Navigate to **Home tab** or **Home screen** to see the changes
- The changes are in the **stats section** and **features section**

## ðŸ“± **Where to See Your Changes**

### **"Modules Done" Text**
- **Location**: Stats section at the top
- **Appears as**: "Modules Done: X/6" (where X is completed modules)

### **"Learn rights in a simplified way" Text**
- **Location**: Features section
- **Card**: "Justice Simplified" card
- **Subtitle**: Now shows "Learn rights in a simplified way"

### **"Test Your Knowledge" Text**
- **Location**: Features section  
- **Card**: Previously "Know Your Rights"
- **Title**: Now shows "Test Your Knowledge"
- **Subtitle**: Now shows "Take a Civic quiz"

## ðŸŽ¯ **Quick Verification**

### **Visual Check**
Look for these exact texts on your Home/Main screen:
1. **Stats Section**: "Modules Done" (instead of "Modules")
2. **Justice Card**: "Learn rights in a simplified way" (instead of "Learn rights in simple language")
3. **Quiz Card**: "Test Your Knowledge" (instead of "Know Your Rights")
4. **Quiz Subtitle**: "Take a Civic quiz" (instead of "Civic quiz section")

### **If Changes Still Don't Appear**
1. **Check you're on the right screen** (Home tab in bottom navigation)
2. **Scroll down** to see the features section
3. **Try switching tabs** and coming back
4. **Force close and reopen** the app completely

## ðŸš€ **Expected Result**

After following these steps, you should see:

### **Before Your Changes**
```
Stats: "Modules: 2/6"
Justice Card: "Learn rights in simple language"
Quiz Card: "Know Your Rights" - "Civic quiz section"
```

### **After Your Changes**
```
Stats: "Modules Done: 2/6"
Justice Card: "Learn rights in a simplified way"  
Quiz Card: "Test Your Knowledge" - "Take a Civic quiz"
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Pro Tips**

1. **Hot Restart vs Hot Reload**: Text changes usually require hot restart (R) not just hot reload (r)
2. **IDE Integration**: Most IDEs have hot restart buttons in the debug toolbar
3. **Terminal Commands**: If running from terminal, press 'R' for hot restart
4. **Complete Restart**: If all else fails, stop the app completely and run `flutter run` again

## âœ… **Confirmation**

Your changes are **correctly saved** in the code. The issue is likely just that the app needs to be restarted to reflect the changes. Follow the troubleshooting steps above, and you should see your improved text appearing in the app!

The changes you made improve the user experience by:
- Making "Modules Done" more descriptive
- Simplifying the language in "Learn rights in a simplified way"
- Making the quiz section more engaging with "Test Your Knowledge"
- Adding action-oriented text with "Take a Civic quiz"

These are excellent UX improvements! ðŸŽ‰
