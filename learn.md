## 3\. Development Considerations

  * **Component Reusability:** The `CategoryCard` should be developed as a reusable component, accepting props for `icon`, `title`, `subtitle`, `backgroundColor`, and an `onPress` handler.
  * **Data Structure:** Model the legal categories as an array of objects to facilitate dynamic rendering of the grid.
  * **State Management:** Implement appropriate state management (e.g., Redux, React Context, Vuex, etc.) for handling search input, filter selections, and navigation states.
  * **Navigation Library:** Utilize a robust navigation library (e.g., React Navigation, GoRouter, etc.) to manage screen transitions smoothly.
  * **Accessibility:** Ensure all interactive UI elements have proper accessibility labels, roles, and sufficient touch targets for inclusive use.
  * **Responsiveness:** Design the grid and overall layout to adapt gracefully to various screen sizes and orientations (e.g., using Flexbox, CSS Grid, or respective platform-specific layout systems).
  * **Styling and Theming:** Define a consistent color palette and typography rules. Consider implementing a theming system for easier maintenance and potential dark mode support.
  * **Iconography:** Plan for how icons will be imported and managed (e.g., SVG assets, icon libraries).
  * **Performance:** Optimize image loading and list rendering (e.g., `FlatList` in React Native, `RecyclerView` in Android, `UICollectionView` in iOS) for smooth user experience, especially with more categories.
