# My Profile Page UI Overview

This README provides a detailed description of the "My Profile" page UI design. The page is structured to offer users a comprehensive overview of their profile, progress, achievements, and quick access to settings.

## 1. Top Section (Header/Profile Summary)

The uppermost part of the page focuses on immediate user identification and profile management.

* **Page Title:** "My Profile" is prominently displayed at the very top, centered, using a clean, sans-serif font.
* **More Options Icon:** To the right of the page title, an icon (likely a vertical ellipsis) indicates additional options or settings.
* **Profile Picture:** A circular placeholder for the user's profile picture is present.
    * An overlaid smaller, circular icon with a purple background and a white camera symbol at the bottom right suggests the functionality to change or upload a new profile photo.
* **User Name:** Directly beneath the profile picture, the name "Sarah Nuang" is displayed in a larger, bold font.
* **User Role/Status:** Below the name, in a smaller font, "Chief Executive Officer" indicates the user's role or status within the app's context.

## 2. Middle Section (Stats/Progress Overview)

This section highlights the user's engagement and progress within the app, featuring gamified elements.

* **Section Title:** "Your Milestones" is the title for this section, with a "VIEW ALL" option to its right for further details.
* **Achievement Card:** A prominent card-like element displays a congratulatory message: "Congratulations!!! Completed 2 more quizzes to unlock a splash." This hints at a gamified reward system.
* **Milestone Progress:** A progress bar or indicator shows "3 of 10 milestones were unlocked," providing a clear visual of user advancement.
* **Key Metrics Cards:** Three distinct white cards present individual metrics:
    * **24:** Labeled "Quizzes Completed."
    * **12h:** Labeled "Time Learning."
    * **5.5%:** Labeled "Average score." (Note: The percentage sign might be slightly misaligned or truncated in some renditions, but refers to average score).
    * **7:** Labeled "Daily Streak."

    Note that if nothing has been completed it should not indicate anything. It should read zero. This also applies to new users.

## 3. Achievements/Badges Section

This area showcases the user's earned badges and rewards.

* **Section Title:** "Badges & Reward" with a "VIEW ALL" option to its right.
* **Badges Grid:** A visual grid of six circular icons, each representing a distinct badge or reward, with varied symbols and background colors:
    * A gold star on a red-orange background.
    * A blue square with a white speech bubble or chat icon.
    * A green shopping cart icon.
    * A purple speech bubble or chat icon (distinct from the blue one).
    * A red heart icon.
    * A blue paper airplane or message icon.
* **Call to Action:** A button labeled "View my all Badges" allows users to explore their full collection of achievements.

    Note that if nothing has been completed it should not indicate anything. It should read zero budges earned. This also applies to new users.


## 4. Settings/Navigation Section

This section provides quick access to various profile-related settings and information. Each item is a clickable menu element.

* **My Profile:**
    * **Icon:** Resembling a person with a checkmark.
    * **Text:** "Edit the personal information."
* **Show Progress:**
    * **Icon:** Resembling a chart or graph.

* **Reset Progress:**
    * **Icon:** Resembling a circular arrow.
    * **Text:** "Start from zero again."
    * A small purple question mark icon to its right may indicate a warning or provide additional information about this action.

## 5. Bottom Navigation Bar

A standard navigation bar is present at the very bottom of the screen, facilitating app-wide navigation.

* The "Profile" icon (resembling a person) is distinctly highlighted, indicating that the user is currently viewing the Profile page. The other four icons represent different main sections of the app.
